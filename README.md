# phase-1-milestone-project-flashcards
 
 Welcome to the final project for Phase 1! Congradulations! 

 This project will be an attempt to quiz the topics you have learned during the series of workshops, as well a provide a useful tool that you can use for school/continuous learning. 

 ### Project Description
 Flash card software has become more and more inaccessible with platfomring increasing paid features, or having clunky UIs. They also tend to need an internet connection to use. In this project you will be creating virtual flash cards from scratch. 

 ### Learning Objectives
 - Soldify understanding of the basics of classes
 - Solidfy understanding of functions/methods
 - Read from a file
 - Get an input from a user
 - Complete tricker test cases based on string formatting

 ### Project Tasks
 - Create the card class
 - Creat a deck class
 - Create a deck reader class (loads deck and gets user input)
 - Create a custom csv file with topics
 Due to the increased complexity of the project each test case will have a description with it below.
